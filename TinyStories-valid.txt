once upon a time there was a little girl who wanted to explore the world. She asked her parents if she could have a passport. Her excited parents said yes. The little girl was so happy. She grabbed her passport and ran out the door. She walked down the street to the passport office. When she got there, she handed the clerk her passport. The clerk said, "I'm sorry, but you've been disqualified. Your passport is not valid." The little girl was embarrassed. She couldn't believe it. She had been so excited to explore the world, and now she couldn't. She had to quit her dream. The little girl went home with her head down. Her parents hugged her and said they were sorry. But the little girl knew that she still had so much to explore and learn in the world, and one day she would be able to get a valid passport and continue her journey.

Claire thought for a bit and said "Can I have a biscuit?". The voice replied "I cannot provide that order. Please provide a valid order". Claire thought again and said "Clean the floor". The strange machine started to move and started to clean the floor. Claire was so surprised! It was so weird seeing the machine clean the floor. When the machine finished cleaning, Claire was very happy. She said "Thank you!" and the strange machine said "You're welcome".

At the airport, they see many people and planes. They have to wait in a long line. Then they have to show their passports to a man. A passport is a small book with your name and picture. It tells where you are from and where you can go. "Can I see your passport, please?" the man asks Tom. "Here you go," Tom says. He opens his passport and gives it to the man.

He takes his passport back and puts it in his pocket. "Can I see your passport, please?" the man asks Lily. "Here you go," Lily says. She opens her passport and gives it to the man. The man looks at it and frowns. "Oh no, Lily. You have a problem. Your passport is not reliable. It is old and torn. It is not valid and safe. You cannot go on the plane," the man says. "What? No!" Lily says. She starts to cry. She does not want to stay at the airport. She wants to go on the big trip with Tom and Mom and Dad. "Don't worry, Lily. We will fix this. We will get you a new passport. It will be fast and easy. Then you can go on the plane," Mom says. She hugs Lily and wipes her tears. "Really?" Lily says. "Really," Mom says. They go to another place where they can get a new passport. They take a picture of Lily and fill out a form. They pay some money and wait for a little while. Then they get a new passport for Lily. It is shiny and new. It has her name and picture. It is reliable. "Here you go, Lily. You have a new passport. It is reliable. It is valid and safe. You can go on the plane," the lady says. "Thank you," Lily says. She opens her new passport and smiles. She is happy and excited again. They go back to the line and show their passports to the man. The man nods and lets them go.

Once there was a curious girl named Sophie. She loved to explore and learn new things. One day, Sophie went on a walk and saw two people arguing. After watching them for a few moments Sophie realized they disagreed but their opinions were balanced. The people were so passionate and Sophie was very curious. She asked them why they were arguing. The people explained that they were talking about what was fair. The taller person said that it wasn't right and the shorter person said that it was. Sophie could see that they both had valid opinions and she said they should balance them. The people smiled and thanked Sophie. With her wise words they decided to both agree to disagree and ended up getting along very well. Sophie was very proud of her wise opinion and learned an important lesson about balancing opinion.
Once upon a time, there was a three year old who loved to win. He practiced and practiced, but he wasn't very good. One day, he heard about a law that said if he could win three battles in a row, he would have a great prize. The three year old was excited! He thought he could do it, so he prepared and tried his best. The first battle he won easily and the second one wasn't too hard either. But the third battle was difficult. He felt uncomfortable and had to use all of his strength to win. When he was done and had won, he celebrated with a big smile on his face. But then someone behind him said, "Sorry kid, you did not follow the law. According to the rules, you needed to win all three battles without using power. Your win is not valid." The three year old felt so disappointed, he wanted to cry. He had worked so hard and yet it was not enough. He smiled sadly and slowly walked away, feeling really uncomfortable.
Once there were two children, who were very different. One was named Sam and the other was named Mia. Sam liked to watch the birds fly in the sky and the clouds move in the wind. Mia preferred to sit and watch books on the bookcase. One day, Sam asked Mia why she spent so much time watching books, when she could be out in the world, like him. Mia told him that she could see so many different stories and places inside her books, and that she could learn different things. Sam was angry, and he yelled at Mia. He didn't understand why she would waste her time with books, when she could go out and play while watching the birds. But then Mia told him that, even if it was different, his way of seeing the world was special too. She explained that while she could learn a lot from books, he could learn even more from the world around him. The children soon realized that both of their ways of seeing the world were valid and important. So, they began to watch and learn differently, but also to support each other. From then on, they both knew that different can often be even better!
Little Bob and his mom were in the park. As they walked, Bob's mom said, "Bob, touch that tree!" Bob touched the tree, feeling the bark's roughness. His mom smiled and said, "That will supply us with apples for our empty basket!" Bob was surprised and excited. Bob and his mom kept walking, enjoying the beautiful sunshine. Then Bob noticed a big tree with lots of apples. His mom smiled, "This is the tree I was talking about - it will supply us with lots of apples!" Bob was so happy that he started to pick some apples and put them in the basket. The basket soon filled up with juicy apples. The next day, Bob and his mom went back to the park. Bob looked for the tree but he couldn't find it. His mom said, "It was an empty tree, so there won't be any more apples for us for now. But one day, it will supply us with apples again - because every touch can return something of validity." Bob understood and waited patiently for the tree to provide them with apples again.
Once upon a time there was a little boy called Joe. He wanted to go out and explore the world, but his parents said no. Joe was very frustrated, he didn't want to resist, but he had to. Then, one day a magical fairy appeared in Joe's bedroom. She gave him a magical ticket and said, "You can use this to travel the world!" Joe was so excited he jumped up and down. He thanked the fairy and ran out of the house. He had to get to his destination before the ticket expired! He ran and ran until he reached the station. There he asked the man for a ticket. The man said the ticket was very expensive, but the fairy whispered into Joe's ear, "It's ok, use the magical ticket!" Joe presented the ticket to the man and he let Joe on the train. The ticket was only valid for a little while, so Joe had to be quick. He explored all the places he wanted to go, and when the ticket expired he returned home safely. Joe was so glad he didn't resist taking the magical ticket. He learned so much about the world and had the best time. He had learned a valuable lesson: never resist the magic of a fairy!
Sara and Tom were going on a big trip with Mom and Dad. They packed their bags and got in the car. Sara was very excited. She wanted to see new things and have fun. Tom was a little scared. He did not like flying in a big plane. "Are we there yet?" Sara asked. "Not yet, sweetie. We have to go to the airport first. Then we have to show our passports and get on the plane," Mom said. "What are passports?" Tom asked. "Passports are like books with your name and picture. They tell the people at the airport who you are and where you are going," Dad explained. Sara and Tom looked at their passports. They had blue covers and shiny pages. Sara liked her passport. She thought it was pretty. Tom did not like his passport. He thought it was boring. They arrived at the airport. It was very big and noisy. There were many people and bags and carts. Sara and Tom held Mom and Dad's hands. They walked to a long line. They waited and waited. Sara was getting bored. Tom was getting hungry. "I want a snack," Tom said. "Me too," Sara said. "Sorry, kids. We can't eat anything until we pass the security check. They might take away our food. We have to rest and be patient," Mom said. Sara and Tom did not like that. They wanted to eat and play. They did not want to rest and be patient. They started to whine and cry. "Shh, shh, it's okay. We'll be there soon. Then we can have something to eat and get on the plane," Dad said. But they were not there soon. The line was very slow. The people at the security check were very strict. They looked at everyone's passports and bags. They made some people take off their shoes and belts. They made some people go through a big machine. They made some people open their bags and show what was inside. Finally, it was Sara and Tom's turn. They gave their passports to a man. The man looked at their passports and frowned. He looked at Sara and Tom and frowned more. He called another man. The other man looked at their passports and frowned too. He called a woman. The woman looked at their passports and frowned even more. She took their passports and walked away. "Hey, where are you going with our passports?" Dad asked. "Sorry, sir. There's a problem with your passports. They are not valid. They are expired. You can't fly today. You have to go back home and get new passports," the woman said. "What? That can't be true. We checked our passports before we left. They are valid. They are not expired. Let me see them," Dad said. "No, sir. You can't see them. They are confiscated. You have to go to the embassy and sort this out. You have to leave the airport now. You have to take your bags and your kids and go," the woman said. Sara and Tom did not understand what was happening. They only understood that they were not going on the big trip. They were not going to see new things and have fun. They were going back home. They were very sad and angry. They screamed and kicked and cried. Mom and Dad were very sad and angry too. They argued with the woman and the men. They asked for their passports and their tickets. They asked for a manager and a lawyer. They asked for help and mercy. But no one listened. No one helped. No one cared. They had to leave the airport. They had to get in the car. They had to drive back home. They had no passports. They had no tickets. They had no trip. They had nothing. The end.
Sam and Ben are brothers. They like to play chess with their dad. Chess is a game with black and white pieces. You have to move the pieces and try to catch the king. One day, Sam and Ben are playing chess with their dad. Sam is black and Ben is white. Sam moves his piece and says, "Check!" That means he can catch the king soon. Ben looks at the board and thinks hard. He does not want to lose. He sees a good move. He moves his piece and says, "Checkmate!" That means he has caught the king and won the game. Sam is sad. He does not like to lose. He says, "That's not fair! You copied my move!" Ben says, "No, I did not copy. I repeated your move. That's a smart thing to do in chess. You have to repeat the good moves and avoid the bad ones." Sam says, "But I did the move first. You should do something different." Ben says, "But why? Repeating is a good strategy. It makes me successful. Dad, tell him!" Dad smiles and says, "Boys, boys, calm down. You both played well. Repeating is a valid move in chess, but it can also be boring. Sometimes it's more fun to try something new and creative. Why don't you play again and see if you can surprise each other?" Sam and Ben agree. They shake hands and set up the board again. They want to have fun and learn more chess. They love to play chess with their dad.

Ben and Mia were twins who loved candy. They liked to eat candy every day after lunch. But their mom said they had to share their candy with their friends. Ben and Mia did not like to share. They wanted to keep all the candy for themselves. One day, they had a clever idea. They decided to mail their candy to their own house. They found a big box and put all their candy inside. Then they wrote their address on the box and put some stamps on it. They asked their dad to take them to the post office. Their dad did not know what was in the box. He thought they were sending a gift to someone. At the post office, Ben and Mia gave the box to the lady behind the counter. They smiled and said, "Thank you!" They were very happy. They thought they would get their candy back in a few days. But they were wrong. The lady behind the counter saw the stamps on the box. She saw that they were old and not valid. She opened the box and saw the candy. She said, "Oh, this is not a gift. This is your candy. You can't mail your candy to yourself. That's silly. You have to take it back." Ben and Mia were very sad. They had to take their box of candy back home. Their mom saw the box and asked them what they did. They told her the truth. Their mom was not angry. She was amused. She said, "That was a clever idea, but not a good one. You should share your candy with your friends. That's more fun and kind. How about we mail some candy to your friends instead?" Ben and Mia agreed. They learned their lesson. They mailed some candy to their friends and kept some for themselves. They ate their candy happily and thanked their mom. They were still clever, but also kind.

Anna and her mom were in the car. They were going to visit grandma, who lived far away. Anna liked grandma, she was very kind and gave her cookies and hugs. But Anna did not like the car, it was boring and noisy. "Mom, are we there yet?" Anna asked. "No, sweetie, we have to drive for a long time. Look, there are many trees and cows outside. Can you count them?" Mom said. Anna tried to count the trees and cows, but she soon lost track. She saw a big red sign that said "STOP". She knew what that meant, mom had taught her. "Mom, you have to stop!" Anna said. "I know, honey, I'm stopping. See, there is a man in a blue uniform. He is a police officer. He wants to talk to me." Mom said. The police officer came to the window of the car. He had a hat and a badge and a big belt. He looked serious. "Hello, ma'am. Do you know why I stopped you?" He asked. Mom looked nervous. She shook her head. "No, officer, I don't. Was I speeding?" She asked. "Yes, you were. You were going 20 miles over the limit. That's very dangerous. I need to see your license and registration, please." He said. Mom opened her purse and looked for her license. It was a small card with her name and picture on it. She gave it to the officer. "Thank you. And your registration?" He asked. Mom opened the glove box and looked for her registration. It was a paper with the car's number and color on it. She gave it to the officer. "Thank you. Please wait here while I check your documents." He said. He walked back to his car. Anna was curious. She wanted to know what the officer was doing. "Mom, what is he doing?" She asked. "He is checking if my license and registration are valid. That means if they are good and not expired. If they are expired, he can give me a ticket. That means I have to pay money for breaking the rule." Mom said. Anna did not like that. She did not want mom to pay money. She wanted mom to buy her a toy or a book. "Mom, can I talk to him?" She asked. "No, honey, you have to stay in the car. It's not polite to interrupt him. He is doing his job." Mom said. But Anna did not listen. She unbuckled her seat belt and opened the door. She ran to the officer's car. She saw him sitting inside, looking at a computer. "Hello, mister!" She said. The officer was surprised. He looked at Anna and smiled. "Hello, little girl. What are you doing here?" He asked. "I want to talk to you. Please don't give mom a ticket. She is very nice and she loves me. She was just in a hurry to see grandma. Grandma is elderly and she lives far away. She needs us to visit her. Please, please, please!" Anna said. The officer was touched by Anna's words. He looked at mom, who was waving and apologizing from the car. He looked at his computer, which showed that mom's license and registration were valid. He looked at Anna, who had big eyes and a hopeful face. He sighed and smiled. "OK, little girl. You are very sweet and brave. I won't give mom a ticket. But you have to promise me something. You have to promise me that you will always wear your seat belt and stay in the car. And you have to tell mom to drive more carefully and follow the speed limit. Can you do that?" He asked. Anna nodded and smiled. "Yes, mister, I promise. Thank you, thank you, thank you!" She said. She hugged the officer and ran back to the car. She hugged mom and told her what happened. Mom was relieved and grateful. She thanked the officer and drove away. They arrived at grandma's house. Grandma was happy to see them. She gave them cookies and hugs. Anna told her the story of the officer and the license. Grandma laughed and praised her. "You are a very good girl, Anna. You saved mom from a ticket. But you also learned a lesson. You have to be safe and respectful on the road. Do you understand?" Grandma said. Anna nodded and smiled. "Yes, grandma, I understand. I love you, grandma." She said. "I love you too, Anna." Grandma said.
Lily was a lawyer. She liked to help people with their problems. She worked in a big building with many books and papers. Sometimes she had to talk to a judge and other lawyers. One day, Lily had a new case. She had to help a man who wanted to keep his dog. His dog was very friendly and smart. He loved his dog very much. But another man said the dog was his. He said he had a paper that proved it. He wanted to take the dog away. Lily met the man and his dog. She saw how happy they were together. She asked the man to tell her his story. He said he found the dog in the street. The dog was hungry and dirty. He gave the dog food and water. He took the dog to the vet. He gave the dog a name and a collar. He taught the dog to sit and fetch. He said the dog was his best friend. Lily said she would try to help him. She looked at the paper that the other man had. She saw that it was old and torn. She saw that it had a different name and address. She thought it was not a good paper. She said she would talk to the judge and the other lawyer. The next day, Lily went to the court. She saw the other lawyer. He was persistent. He said he had the right to take the dog. He said the paper was enough. He said the dog belonged to him. Lily said no. She said the paper was not enough. She said the dog belonged to the man who found him. She said the man loved the dog and cared for him. She said the dog was happy with the man. She said the judge should let them stay together. The judge listened to both lawyers. He looked at the paper and the dog. He thought for a while. Then he made his decision. He said the paper was not valid. He said the dog belonged to the man who found him. He said the man could keep his dog. He said the other lawyer had to leave. The man and his dog were very happy. They thanked Lily for her help. They hugged her and licked her face. Lily smiled and said she was glad to help. She said they were a good team. She said they deserved to be happy. She said goodbye and went back to her office. She felt good about her job. She liked to help people with their problems. She was a good lawyer.
Tom and Anna were twins who liked to draw. They had many crayons and papers to make original pictures. Sometimes they drew animals, sometimes they drew houses, sometimes they drew their family. One day, they decided to draw their opinions. Tom drew a big sun with a smiley face and wrote "I like sunny days". Anna drew a big cloud with raindrops and wrote "I like rainy days". They showed each other their pictures and smiled. But then, their big brother Sam came and saw their pictures. He laughed and said "Your opinions are silly. Sunny days are too hot and rainy days are too wet. The best days are windy days, like today. Look, I drew a kite flying in the sky. That's a smart opinion." Tom and Anna felt sad and angry. They did not like Sam's words. They liked their own opinions. They did not want to draw anymore. They put away their crayons and papers and hugged each other. Mom saw them and asked "What's wrong, my loves?" Tom and Anna told her what Sam said. Mom frowned and said "Sam, that was not nice. You should not make fun of your siblings' opinions. Everyone has different opinions and that's okay. You can like windy days, but you should not say that other days are silly. You should respect and appreciate your siblings' original pictures. They are very creative and beautiful." She turned to Tom and Anna and said "Don't listen to Sam. Your opinions are not silly. They are yours and they are valid. You can like sunny days or rainy days or any days you want. You can draw whatever you want. Your pictures are wonderful and I love them. You are my smart and talented twins." She gave them a big hug and a kiss and comforted them. Tom and Anna felt better and smiled. They thanked Mom and said "We love you, Mom. And we love our opinions. And we love our pictures. And we love each other." They took out their crayons and papers again and continued to draw. They drew more opinions and more original pictures. They also drew a big heart and wrote "We love Mom". They showed it to Mom and she smiled and said "I love you too, my loves. You make me very happy."
Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They make noises with their mouths as they drive them on the floor. "Vroom, vroom, beep, beep!" Tom says as he moves his red car. "Honk, honk, screech, screech!" Sam says as he moves his blue car. They pretend they are in a race. They go fast and slow, turn and stop. They have fun. But then they hear a loud noise outside. It is not a toy car. It is a real car. It is big and yellow. It has a siren and a light on top. It is a police car. "Wow, look at that!" Tom says as he runs to the window. "Me too, me too!" Sam says as he follows him. They see the police car stop in front of their house. They see a man get out of the car. He has a hat and a badge. He is a police officer. He walks to their door and knocks. "Who is it?" their mom asks as she opens the door. "Hello, ma'am. I'm Officer Jones. I'm here to check your license," the police officer says. "My license? What for?" their mom asks. The police officer points to their dad's car in the driveway. It has a sticker on the window. It says "Expired". "Your car's license is expired, ma'am. That means it is not valid. You need to renew it or you can't drive it," the police officer says. "Oh, I see. I'm sorry, I forgot to do that. Thank you for reminding me, officer. I'll do it right away," their mom says. She takes out her wallet and shows the police officer her license. He looks at it and writes something on a paper. He gives it to her. "This is a warning, ma'am. Please renew your car's license as soon as possible. Have a nice day," the police officer says. He goes back to his car and drives away. Tom and Sam watch him go. They are amazed. "Mom, what is a license?" Tom asks. "A license is a paper that says you can do something, like drive a car or ride a bike. You need to have one and follow the rules, or the police will come and talk to you," their mom explains. "Oh, I see. Can we have a license too?" Sam asks. "Maybe when you are older, sweetie. But for now, you can play with your toy cars. Just don't make too much noise, okay?" their mom says. "Okay, mom. We love you," Tom and Sam say. They hug their mom and go back to their room. They play with their toy cars again. But they are more careful. They don't want the police to come back. They want to be good drivers.
Anna loves to draw with her crayons. She likes to make pictures of animals, flowers, and rainbows. She has a big book with many pages where she keeps her drawings. She is very proud of her book and wants to show it to everyone. One day, she brings her book to school. She wants to display her drawings to her friends and teacher. She says, "Look at my book! I made these pictures with my crayons. Do you like them?" Her friends and teacher smile and say, "Wow, Anna, your pictures are very pretty and colorful. You are very good at drawing."
